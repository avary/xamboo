Xamboo for GO v0
=============================

Xamboo is the result of over 15 years of manufacturing engineering frameworks, originally written for PHP 7+ and now ported to GO 1.8+

It is a very high quality framework for CMS, made in GO 1.8 or higher, fully object-oriented and strong to distribute code into Web portals with heavy load and REST APIs optimization.

Xamboo is freeware, and uses several other freeware components (XConfig, XCore)

Xamboo is an engine to build applications that distribute any type of code to the client:
It is completely independent of the generated code, i.e. you can send HTML, XHTML, XML, SGML, javascript, JS, JSON, WAP, PDF, etc.

Xamboo works on sites currently distributing more than **60 millions web pages monthly**, (that's near 500 pages per second on peak hour) it serves regular sites, and GRAPH-APIs / REST APIs to APP-mobiles.


TO DO
=======================
- creates a fake SSH key cert for examples to put in examples dir
- simple code server injector, finish all supported code
- language server injector (beautify output)
- template server injector (beautify output)
- Caches generator from XCore
- Host Resolution problem when the config.json file have a blank IP (to listen to all server IPs)
- Stats module
- Make admin site available with login for security
- Errors manager and Logs managers
- Verify memory leaks on destroy objects/garbage collector
Extras:
- page library and snippets PHP-compatible code ? (check go call PHP with pipe data interchange)
- page library and snippets JS-compatible code ? (check go call NODE with pipe data interchange)

Version Changes Control
=======================

V0.0.8 - 2019-01-21
-----------------------
> Uses XConfig 0.0.5

> Uses XCore 0.0.4

- CacheLibrary modified to have no timeout (.so are part of the code itself and cannot unload)
- admin/listener enhanced to get read and write independant on go threads
- admin console now receive and display last served pages and files (very basic interface)

V0.0.7 - 2019-01-06
-----------------------
> Uses XConfig 0.0.5

> Uses XCore 0.0.4

- Code modified to use new XDataset/XConfig with capabilities for XTemplate
- Function servers.Start added to call caches starters (file validator function added)
- Caches modified to use last version of XCore


V0.0.6 - 2018-12-21
-----------------------
> Uses XConfig 0.0.4

> Uses XCore 0.0.2

- Code modified to use xconfig.Get* with double variables return

V0.0.5 - 2018-12-17
-----------------------
> Uses XConfig 0.0.3

> Uses XCore 0.0.2

- Moved servers/cache.go to xcore
- Remasterization of all directories and place of code, more logical. "servers" and "context" are now into engine. 
  "core" disappears, "config" is separated, creation of "log" and "stat" as intependant code. The core as itself is renamed "runner"
  
V0.0.4 - 2018-12-05
-----------------------
> Uses XConfig 0.0.3

> Uses XCore 0.0.1

- Added the pre-load for user application plugins, bridge and calls from library pages (.go compiled code)
- .Code regexp modified so a comment may have a new line at the end that will not reflect on the final code
- Support for static files added on each host. New config parameter "static" added in Host for filesystem path of static files
- Admin console enhanced
- Stat module created

V0.0.3 - 2018-12-04
-----------------------
> Branch "late-night" added to github

> Uses XConfig 0.0.3

> Uses XCore 0.0.1

- The servers auto-reload data from pages sources if there is any change into the code and invalid the cache
- The library server can (re)compile the .go page if needed and can hot-load the plugin library on the fly (beware to the memory use !)
- language page type implemented
- template page type implemented
- library page type implemented
- [[URLPARAMS]] metalanguage parser and injector implemented
- [[URLPARAM,id]] metalanguage parser and injector implemented
- [[VAR,id]] metalanguage parser and injector implemented
- [[PARAM,id]] metalanguage parser and injector implemented
- [[SYSPARAM,id]] metalanguage parser and injector implemented
- [[PAGEPARAM,id]] metalanguage parser and injector implemented
- [[LOCALPAGEPARAM,id]] metalanguage parser and injector implemented
- [[INSTANCEPARAM,id]] metalanguage parser and injector implemented
- [[LOCALINSTANCEPARAM,id]] metalanguage parser and injector implemented
- Nested blocks [[BOX...BOX]] metalanguage parser and injector implemented
- Constants added for meta language orders

V0.0.3 - 2018-??-??
-----------------------
> This version is working, examples are working, but the system is still incomplete

> Uses XConfig 0.0.3
- Added XCache to manage persistent memory caches


V0.0.2 - 2018-11-27
-----------------------
> This version is working, examples are working, but the system is still incomplete

> Uses XConfig 0.0.2
- Added Context in engine and local context to calculate pages
- Added engine wrapper to call from a server (engine callback for a sub-page)
- Added support for memory caches in servers (page, instance, code)
- ".code" compiler implemented for simple pages
- Added language, template, code, library, cache servers
- Added identity server to calculate the correct identity for each page object
- Creation of Context object to send to every engine instance/page to build
- Logger implemented (now directed to stdout)
- Added VERSION constant in core/core.go

V0.0.1 - 2018-11-06
-----------------------
> Uses XConfig 0.0.1
- First commit, still not fully working

Types of pages:
=======================

Simple Page (.code)
-----------------------

The type of the page in the .page file must be 
type=simple

The code of the page is your native code (for instance HTML) and you can use a MetaLanguage to insert and use business rules into the construction of the page:

* Meta language for Simple Page:

- [[URLPARAMS]]
- [[URLPARAM,(.*?)]]
- [[VAR,(.*?)]]
- [[PARAM,(.*?)]]
- [[SYSPARAM,(.*?)]]
- [[PAGEPARAM,(.*?)]]
- [[LOCALPAGEPARAM,(.*?)]]
- [[INSTANCEPARAM,(.*?)]]
- [[LOCALINSTANCEPARAM,(.*?)]]
- [[JS,(.*?)]]
- [[CSS,(.*?)]]
- [[CALL,(.*?)(:(.*?)){0,1}]]
- ##   ##
- %--   --%
- [[BOX,(.*?):
- BOX]]
