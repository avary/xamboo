Xamboo for GO v0.0.2
=======================
This is the build 2

Xamboo is the result of over 15 years of manufacturing engineering frameworks, originally written for PHP 7+ and now ported to GO 1.8+

It is a very high quality framework for CMS, made in GO 1.8 or higher, fully object-oriented and strong to distribute code into Web portals with heavy load and REST APIs optimization.

Xamboo is freeware, and uses several other freeware components (XConfig)

Xamboo is an engine to build applications that distribute any type of code to the client:
It is completely independent of the generated code, i.e. you can send HTML, XHTML, XML, SGML, javascript, JS, JSON, WAP, PDF, etc.

Xamboo works on sites currently distributing more than **60 millions web pages monthly**, (that's near 500 pages per second on peak hour) it serves regular sites, and GRAPH-APIs / REST APIs to APP-mobiles.
